# NOTES (2019-08-18)
* Added Google map, but it's height is hard-coded - so far, there doesn't appear to be a way to have tehe map simply 'fill up' the container it's in... The map height needs to be specified in pixels, right now it's hardcoded (card height + card height - card top margin - 2px for card borders). There should be a way to get the heights of the two cards in the other column (or the other column's height) and then calculate the map's height so it's repsonsive.
* The latitude and longitude values generated by faker are (understandably) all over the earth, and often in the middle of an ocean, so the zoom level of the map has been set to 'world'
